    "ourStorySubHeadingB": "Our Move Towards Organic",
    "ourStoryTextA": "Formed in 2018, ProOrganica is the latest addition to Chemex's growing portfolio of business ventures focussed on the sourcing, handling, and supplying of organic produce in Ukraine. This is our story up until now.",
    "ourStoryTextB": "Chemex Ltd has been in the agricultural industry for over thirty years — starting out as a fertiliser and raw materials trading company in Donetsk, a city located in the centre of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. In 2014 an armed conflict swept through the region leading to the mass displacement of thousands of people and forcing us to relocate our business to Kiev. During this turbulent period we were forced to rethink the direction of our business, deciding that the time was right to start orientating towards the creative industries. Now, six years on, we are in the process of re-positioning Chemex ltd as an engine for innovation, creativity, and social entrepreneurship in Ukraine.",
    "ourStoryTextC": "With its unique growing conditions, vast swathes of uncultivated land, and close proximity to some of the largest organic markets in the world, the potential of Ukraine's organic market is unprecedented. With our proven expertise in material sourcing, handling, and logistics the organics market was a natural next step for Chemex. So in the last few years we've started shifting part of our business operations and resources towards this promising market. ProOrganica is the latest addition joining Chemex ltd — the official distributor of YOGI TEA — as the processing, packaging, logistics, quality control and exporting branch of this business division. To implement this, in 2019 we acquired processing facilities and a large plot of land next to Kiev where we will run pilot projects in our processing factory for organic materials. We aim to present our first processed products to the market in 2020.",

    "ukraineSubHeadingC": "Established Farmers",
    "ukraineSubHeadingD": "Highly Competitive Pricing",
    "ukraineTextA": "The global organic market is developing dynamically as the demand for organic produce continues to grow. Ukraine, with its vast swathes of fertile land and geographical location between Europe and Asia is poised to be a key supplier in the market.",
    "ukraineTextB": "Ukraine is the largest country in Europe with a total area of 60.3 million hectares, including 42.7 million hectares of agricultural land, owning 33% of the world’s most fertile black top soils. Ukraine is ranked 11th in Europe according to the volume of organic agricultural area amounting 859 000 hectares: 201 000 hectares of fully converted land + 88 000 hectares of agricultural land in conversion + 570 000 hectares of wild area.Ukraine has outstanding potential to become a major global supplier of organic products as only 0.7% of its total farmland is now organic. Currently, under a national moratorium there are 41.5 million hectares of agricultural land of which 7% is not cultivated at all. Those lands that have been idle for decades are now being put to productive use with a focus on organic farming. With the planned opening of the land market, a new stage in Ukraine's agricultural productivity is expected.",
    "ukraineTextC": "Thanks to its size, geographical location, temperature climate, proximity to potential international buyers, and widespread fertile black top soils, Ukraine has extremely favourable conditions for organic agriculture.",
    "ukraineTextD": "Ukraine already has an established history in organic production: globally it is ranked 6th in organic oilseed production and 8th in organic wheat. There are already around 500 organic operators in Ukraine which are certified according to the EU organic standard, and/or US National Organic Program (NOP), Bio Suisse (Switzerland), Bioland and Naturland (Germany), COR (Canada), Soil Association (UK), and KRAV (Sweden).",
    "ukraineTextE": "The “Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements” signed between Ukraine and the EU ensures lower tariffs and EU import duties. Ukrainian laws passed in 2018 on the basic principles and requirements of organic production, trade and labelling are now aligned with the European Union's organic legislation. Due to its geographical position between Europe and Asia, and access to deepwater ports in the Black Sea, Ukraine can ship goods nearly anywhere extremely competitively. Ukraine is highly competitive with its premium quality organic food products due to lower costs of resources, energy and labour.",
